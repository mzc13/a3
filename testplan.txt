We were only able to implement the HELLO and GDBYE commands due to time restrictions.
To test what we have we run the server and client with improper command line arguments
and the response was as we expected. Then, we try with proper arguments and check the 
server and client side to see if the connection succeeded and prints something on both
sides. Our help command on the client side works. To test concurrency we try connecting
to the server with multiple clients at once and one client after the next. To test quit
we look at the outputs on the server end to see if the message was received and then 
check the cilent end as well to see if it quits successfully.
